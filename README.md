This is my portfolio, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

**Local setup**

You can run this project as-is, you just need to install the Hugo CLI and execute `hugo server -D` and go to the indicated localhost URL.

To deploy this project you can use the Netlify CLI. Just build the static site with `hugo -D` and deploy using `netlify deploy`.

That's it. ðŸ˜‰
